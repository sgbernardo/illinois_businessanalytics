## 🧭 Overview & Setup

This tutorial walks you through on:

1. Extract usernames from retweets using a regular expression
2. How to create a directed graph data structure
3. How to run a network analysis based on the number of **retweets**
4. How to create a graph visualization


### 📦 Install and load packages

Install `tidyverse` and `igraph` if you do not have them in your R environment.

- `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages for data science
- `igraph` is a collection of network analysis tools

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# uncomment and run the lines below if you need to install these packages
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("igraph")
```

Load packages.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
```



## 🔍 Data Preparation

### 📃 Read CSV file

Ensure you use a retweets dataset. Your filename should end with `-retweets.csv` (e.g., `Tesla-retweets.csv`).

```{r}
df_retweets = read_csv('Lululemon-retweets.csv')
df_retweets %>% head()
```

Print out the number of rows.

```{r}
nrow(df_retweets)
```



### 📌 Handle usernames

#### Rename `username` column

Rename `username` column to `retweet_username`. This column contains the usernames who retweeted other tweets.

```{r}
# rename username column to retweet_username
# retweet_username column contains the username who retweeted the original tweet
if ("username" %in% colnames(df_retweets)) {
  df_retweets <- df_retweets %>% rename(
    retweet_username = username
  )
}

df_retweets %>% head()
```


#### Extract original authors

Every retweet starts with "RT @" and is followed by the original author's username. Here is a sample retweet.

> RT @original_user: Here is a tweet.

Extract usernames using a regular expression.

```{r}
# extract username using regular expression
# "^" refers to the beginning of a line
# "\w+" matches one or more alphanumeric and underscore characters
# "[, 2]" only extracts the username portion
df_retweets$original_username <- str_match(df_retweets$text, "^RT @(\\w+)")[, 2]

# display the mentions column in the first few rows
df_retweets %>% head() %>% select(text, original_username)
```



## 🚀 Perform network analysis

### 🐬 Create a DataFrame that describes a directed graph

Each retweet can be represented as a directed edge in a graph that connects *from* the retweeter's username *to* the original author's username.

```{r}
edges <- df_retweets %>% 
  select(retweet_username, original_username) %>% 
  rename(
    from = retweet_username,
    to = original_username
  )

edges <- unnest(edges, cols=to)

# display 20 first rows
head(edges, n = 20)
```


### 🧪 Create a graph

We created the `edges` DataFrame in one of the previous steps. We can build a graph object using the DataFrame. `directed = TRUE` parameter is used to create a directed graph.

```{r}
graph <- graph_from_data_frame(edges, directed = TRUE)

# print graph
graph
```


### 🧮 Calculate in-degree centrality

```{r}
# calculate degree centrality
deg <- degree(graph, mode = "in")

# sort by degree centrality in descending order
deg <- deg %>%
  sort(decreasing = TRUE)

deg %>% head()
```


Check the number of vertices (i.e., users) in our graph

```{r}
gorder(graph)
```



### 🧞 Top influencers by number of retweets

Identify the top 20 users by number of retweets.

```{r}
top20 <- deg %>% head(n = 20)
top20 %>% head(20)
```


`top20` is a named numeric vector. Convert it to a DataFrame. This will allow us to add new columns.

```{r}
top20 <- top20 %>%
  enframe(name = "username", value="retweeted_count") 

top20
```


```{r}
ggplot(
  data = head(top20, n = 20),
  aes(x = retweeted_count, y = reorder(username, retweeted_count))
) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab("Number of Retweets by Other Users") +
  ylab("Username")
```


## ✨ Graph visualization

### 🔨 Network graph of all users

```{r}
plot(
  graph,
  layout = layout_with_fr(graph),
  main="Retweets network graph of all users",
  edge.arrow.size = 0.15,
  edge.color = "#BBDFFF",
  vertex.label = NA,
  vertex.color = "#20DFFF",
  vertex.frame.color = "#00BFFF",
  vertex.size = 0.2
)
```



### 💎 Top retweeted users within the largest connected component

```{r warning=FALSE}
# find the connected components of our graph
gc <- igraph::components(graph)

# delete users that are outside the largest connected component
graph_filtered <- delete_vertices(graph, gc$membership != which.max(gc$csize))

# calculate in-degrees within the filtered graph
filtered_deg_in <- degree(graph_filtered, mode = "in")
vertex_size <- pmax(pmin(filtered_deg_in * 0.08, 6), 0.3)

# find the top 12 retweeted users within the filtered graph
top_retweeted_users <- filtered_deg_in %>%
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%
  head(n = 12) %>%
  names()

plot(
  graph_filtered,
  layout = layout_with_fr(graph_filtered),
  main="Top retweeted users within the largest connected component",
  edge.arrow.size = 0.15,
  edge.color = "#BBDFFF",
  vertex.label = ifelse(
    names(filtered_deg_in) %in% top_retweeted_users,
    V(graph_filtered)$name,
    NA
  ),
  vertex.label.cex = 0.8,
  vertex.label.color = "#000000",
  vertex.color = "#20DFFF",
  vertex.frame.color = "#00BFFF",
  vertex.size = vertex_size
)
```
