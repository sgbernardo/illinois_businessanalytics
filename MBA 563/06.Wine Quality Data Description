# About the data: 
*This data is about wine quality and how different factors predict wine quality. The source of data is in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

# Brief description of each column:
fixed.acidity - the amount of acid that do not readily evaporate
volatile.acidity - amount of acetic acid in wine, which can adversely affect taste
citric.acid - amount of citric acid in wine, which helps in the taste of the wine
residual.sugar - amount of sugar post-fermentation
chlorides - salt content in the wine
free.sulfur.dioxide - the amount of free sulfur oxide, which prevents microbial growth and oxidation of the wine
total.sulfur.dioxide - the total amount of sulfur oxide (includes free and bound forms)
density - density of water 
pH - the acidity and basic of the wine, where a lower number indicates acidic. 
sulphates - amount of sulphates, which can boost anti-microbial protection
alcohol - alcohol content in wine
quality - score between 0 to 10 based on scoring by wine tasters
